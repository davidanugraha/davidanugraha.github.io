Hi! I'm David Anugraha, an incoming MS CS Student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I completed my Bachelor's degree at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I studied Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning, Statistics, and Chemistry. My current research interests primarily lie in the areas of LMs, multilingual NLP, multi-modality, and evaluation. I am also interested in exploring other areas, such as agentic systems and statistical approaches to develop robust and generalizable AI systems. Additionally, I have also been involved in data-driven decision-making in various research areas, including parallel and distributed databases, as well as drug discovery using machine learning.

At University of Toronto, I have been working with [Annie En-Shiun Lee](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ealee/public/) on investigating robust and efficient methods to evaluate NLP tasks under Low-Resource settings. I have also conducted research with [Maryam Mehri Dehnavi](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mmehride/) to explore techniques for more efficient pre-training and inference, focusing on model compression on LLMs.

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and singing, exploring new foods, and watching professional eSports! Feel free to reach out if you ever want to chat, whether itâ€™s about research, random ideas, or even the latest food trends making the rounds!
