Hi! I'm David Anugraha, currently working as a Research Engineer in the Distributed Data & Management Lab at [Huawei Canada](https://www.huawei.com/ca/). I completed my Bachelor's degree at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I studied Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning, Statistics, and Chemistry. My current research interests primarily lie in the areas of Language Models, Multilingual NLP, and Low-Resource NLP. I am also interested in the generalization and robustness of AI systems, including multi-modal systems. Additionally, I have also been involved in data-driven decision-making in various research areas, including parallel and distributed databases, as well as drug discovery using machine learning.

At University of Toronto, I have been working with [Annie En-Shiun Lee](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ealee/public/) on investigating robust and efficient methods to evaluate NLP tasks under Low-Resource settings. I have also conducted research with [Maryam Mehri Dehnavi](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mmehride/) to explore techniques for more efficient pre-training and inference, focusing on model compression on LLMs.

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and singing, exploring new foods, and watching professional eSports!
